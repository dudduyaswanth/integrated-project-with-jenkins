       <p style="color:#4d4d4d";>
       <b>1) Of the 118.5 million blood donations collected globally, 40% of these are collected in high-income countries, home to 16% of the world’s population.<b><br>
       <b><b><br>
       <b>2) In low-income countries, up to 54 % of blood transfusions are given to children under 5 years of age; whereas in high-income countries, the most frequently transfused patient group is over 60 years of age, accounting for up to 75% of all transfusions.<b><br>
       <b><b><br>
       <b>3) Based on samples of 1000 people, the blood donation rate is 31.5 donations in high-income countries, 15.9 donations in upper-middle-income countries, 6.8 donations in lower-middle-income countries and 5.0 donations in low-income countries.<b><br>
       <b><b><br>
       <b>4) An increase of 7.8 million blood donations from voluntary unpaid donors has been reported from 2013 to 2018. In total, 79 countries collect over 90% of their blood supply from voluntary unpaid blood donors; however, 56 countries collect more than 50% of their blood supply from family/replacement or paid donors.<b><br>
       <b><b><br>
       <b>5) Only 55 of 171 reporting countries produce plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMP) through the fractionation of plasma collected in the reporting country. A total of 90 countries reported that all PDMP are imported, 16 countries reported that no PDMP were used during the reporting period, and 10 countries did not respond to the question.<b></p>
       <h1 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">National blood policy and organization</h1>
      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. Providing safe and adequate blood should be an integral part of every country’s national health care policy and infrastructure. WHO recommends that all activities related to blood collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution be coordinated at the national level through effective organization and integrated blood supply networks. The national blood system should be governed by national blood policy and legislative framework to promote uniform implementation of standards and consistency in the quality and safety of blood and blood products.<br>
      <b><b><br>
      <b>In 2018,72 % of reporting countries, or 123 out of 171, had a national blood policy. Overall, 64% of reporting countries, or 110 out of 171, have specific legislation covering the safety and quality of blood transfusion, including:
      79% of high-income countries,63% of middle-income countries,39% of low-income countries.<b></p>
    </div>

    <h1 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">Blood Supply</h1>
    <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>About 118.4 million blood donations are collected worldwide. 40% of these are collected in high-income countries, home to 16 % of the world’s population.
      About 13 300 blood centres in 169 countries report collecting a total of 106 million donations. Collections at blood centres vary according to income group. The median annual donations per blood centre is 1 300 in the low-income countries, 4 400 in lower-middle-income countries and 9 300 in upper-middle-income countries, as compared to 25 700 in high-income countries.<b><br>
      <b><b><br>
     <b>There is a marked difference in the level of access to blood between low- and high-income countries. The whole blood donation rate is an indicator for the general availability of blood in a country. The median blood donation rate in high-income countries is 31.5 donations per 1000 people. This compares with 15.9 donations per 1000 people in upper-middle-income countries, 6.8 donations per 1000 people in lower-middle-income countries, and  five donations per 1000 people in low-income countries.<b><br>
      <b><b><br>
      <b>62 countries report collecting fewer than 10 donations per 1000 people. Of these, 34 countries are in the WHO African Region,  four in the WHO Region of the Americas, six in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region,  three in the WHO European Region, six in the WHO South-Eastern Asia Region, and nine in the WHO Western Pacific Region. All are low- or middle-income countries.<b><br></p>
 
     <h1 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">Blood Screening</h1>
     <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>WHO recommends that all blood donations should be screened for infections prior to use. Screening for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis should be mandatory. Blood screening should be performed according to quality system requirements. Of reporting countries, 12 are not able to screen all donated blood for one or more of the above infections.
     99.8% of the donations in high-income countries and 99.9% in upper-middle-income countries are screened following basic quality procedures, as compared to 82% in lower-middle-income countries and 80.3 % in low-income countries. The prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infections in blood donations in high-income countries is considerably lower than in low- and middle-income countries (Table 1).<b></p>

      <h1 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">Clinical use of blood</h1>
      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>Unnecessary transfusions and unsafe transfusion practices expose patients to the risk of serious adverse transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmissible infections. Unnecessary transfusions also reduce the availability of blood products for patients who are in need.
      WHO recommends the development of systems, such as hospital transfusion committees and haemovigilance, to monitor and improve the safety of transfusion processes. In this regard:<b><br>
      <b><b><br>
      <b>1) 128 countries have national guidelines on the appropriate clinical use of blood: 32 countries in the African region (74% of reporting countries in the region), 22 in the Americas (67 %), 13 in the Eastern Mediterranean (68 %), 33 in Europe (80%), nine in the South East Asia (90 %), and 19 in the Western Pacific (76%).<b><br>
      <b><b><br>
      <b>2) Transfusion committees are present in 50 % of the hospitals performing transfusions: 65% in hospitals in high-income countries, 35% in upper-middle-income countries, 31 in lower-middle-income countries and 25% in low-income countries.<b><br>
      <b><b><br>
      <b>3) Systems for reporting adverse transfusion events are present in 57% of the hospitals performing transfusions: 76% in hospitals in high-income countries, 35% in upper-middle-income countries, 22% in lower-middle-income countries and 18% in low-income countries, 
      49% of reporting countries have a haemovigilance system. The European region has the highest percentage of countries with haemovigilance systems (83%), followed by the Western Pacific (48%), the Eastern Mediterranean (47%), Africa (40%), South-East Asia (40%), and the Americas (21%).
