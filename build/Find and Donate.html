      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>As the COVID-19 public health crisis continues, our mission to sustain the blood supply is tested in new ways that require our vigilance and flexibility. When viral spread subsides, recovery will require steadfast unity, and equal parts planning and adaptation for months to come. One of the ways you can prepare for a conversation with our representative is to examine your calendar for opportunities to host blood drives over the next year. Some areas least impacted by COVID-19 can help us sustain patients in areas most impacted, so we may call upon your service at times of greatest need as the situation evolves. We are grateful for your commitment and flexibility during this challenging time and looking forward to coming TOGETHER again in service.<b> </p>
       <h2 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">Why Is It Important?</h2>
      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>A specific injury or sickness can cause lost blood in the influenced, along these lines, representing the danger of death if the blood level isn’t taken back to the ordinary. Blood is an essential flood that moves oxygen to other indispensable body parts. With the loss of blood from the body doesn’t get vital oxygen bringing about death. In such a case emerges the requirement for deliberate blood gift from another person, regardless of whether known or obscure to the person.Any sound individual could elect to give blood to help an individual out of luck. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) keeps up blood donation centers in pretty much every significant city/town.Any individual who is eager to give blood can move toward these blood donation centers, where they will be guided further by a clinical expert. Medical clinics and Non-government Organizations likewise compose blood gift camps occasionally, to support individuals for blood gift.<b></p>

      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>A considerable percentage of students have low awareness of and negative attitude towards blood donation. The low awareness and negative attitude towards blood donation can be considered as important factors contributing to the lack of interest and poor participation in blood donation among this population. Therefore, there is a critical need for training and culture building activities and programs in order to increase university students’ awareness and improve their attitude towards blood donation.<b></p><br>
      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;"><b>Our  results  are  similar  to  those 3,8obtained in other  Indian study  and few 7Western  surveys   with  slight  variations suggesting  people  have similar  attitudes as a whole.  These data contribute to our understanding  of public  concerns  about blood  transfusion  and  may  help identify public  perception  that  may  help  in increasing  our  voluntary  donor  pool  by taking  optimum  necessary  steps compatible and acceptable to our public.  In  India  it  has  been  observed  that :-Retention of old donors becomes easier if the  task  of  donor  motivation  and recruitment  are  in  the  hands  of  one  or more  well - organised voluntary organizations  rather  than  on  the transfusion  service  its elf.  Such  organizations may have separate identity but  should  work  hard  inhand  with  the transfusion service in a well co-ordinated manner with mutual respect for each other as an essential member of the team.<b></p>

      <h2 style="color:black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">Some text..</h2>
      <p style="color:#4d4d4d;">There are four major blood groups determined by the presence or absence of two antigens – A and B – on the surface of red blood cells. In addition to the A and B antigens, there is a protein called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent (–), creating the 8 most common blood types (A+, A-,  B+, B-,  O+, O-,  AB+, AB-). Just 1 donation can save up to 3 lives. The average red blood cell transfusion is 3 pints (or 3 whole-blood donations).More than 1 million people every year are diagnosed with cancer for the first time. Many of them will need blood—sometimes daily—during chemotherapy.More than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.Type O-negative whole blood can be transfused to people with any blood type, but this type of blood is rare, and supplies of it are low.</p>
