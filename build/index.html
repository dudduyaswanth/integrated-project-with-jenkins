      <h1 style="color: black; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #FF0000">BLOOD DONATION (Yahwanth)</h1>
      <p style="color:black;">A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical
medications by a process called fractionation. Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific
components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.
Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries,
established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).</p>
      <p style="color:black;">Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased
confidence in oneself, helping a personal friend/relative, and social pressure. Despite the many reasons that people donate, not
enough potential donors actively donate. However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations increase, often creating
an excess supply that will have to be later discarded. However, in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in
 some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own
future use. Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may
feel faint.</p>
